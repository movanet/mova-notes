## Manual Deployment (Legacy Method)

This guide explains the manual process for exporting and deploying using the Webpage HTML Export plugin to Netlify.

## Export Process

### 1. Export from Obsidian

1. Open Obsidian and load the `obsidianpublish` vault
2. Open Command Palette: `Ctrl/Cmd + P`
3. Search for: **"Webpage HTML Export: Export Vault"**
4. Choose export location (recommended: `D:\Obsidian\obsidianpublish-export`)
5. Wait for export to complete

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Netlify Drop (Easiest for testing)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag and drop the exported folder
3. Netlify will provide a temporary URL
4. To make it permanent, link to your GitHub account

#### Option B: GitHub + Netlify (Recommended for production)

1. **Prepare Git Repository:**
   ```bash
   cd D:\Obsidian\obsidianpublish-export
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial export from Webpage HTML Export"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/movanet/Published.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Choose GitHub and select `movanet/Published`
   - **Build settings:**
     - Build command: (leave empty)
     - Publish directory: `/` (or `.` - the exported HTML is ready to serve)
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Configure Custom Domain:**
   - In Netlify site settings, go to "Domain management"
   - Add custom domain: `notes.alafghani.info`
   - Update DNS records as instructed by Netlify
   - Wait for SSL certificate to be provisioned

#### Option C: Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
cd D:\Obsidian\obsidianpublish-export
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Ongoing Workflow

### When You Update Content:
