# Lake Governance Policy Network Analysis

## Overview

This comprehensive analysis examines the governance dynamics of lake management in Indonesia, revealing how **governance failure rather than technical deficit** lies at the heart of environmental crises in priority lakes.

## Interactive Visualization

### [üåê Policy-Network-Actor Diagram ‚Üí](rawapening-network/index.html)

An interactive D3.js visualization showing the complex relationships between 18 institutional actors, 11 policies, and 10 governance paradoxes.

**Features:**
- **Tier Filtering**: Toggle between National, Provincial, Local, and Community actors
- **Relationship Types**: Filter by Coordination, Conflict, Budget, Information flows, and Gaps
- **Paradox Highlighting**: Explore 10 documented governance failures
- **Theme Analysis**: Filter by 10 analytical themes (A-J)
- **Bilingual**: Full English and Bahasa Indonesia support
- **Search**: Find specific actors or policies
- **Power Stratification**: Visual representation of formal vs actual authority

## Key Findings

### 10 Governance Paradoxes Identified

1. **Authority Without Legitimacy** - National decree expands lake 67% without consultation, enforced by military
2. **Coordination Without Power** - Coordination body cannot override national regulations
3. **800ha Regulatory Black Hole** - Unresolved spatial contradiction since 2023
4. **Institutional Orphaning** - Watershed agency lost authority post-2017, no replacement
5. **18,000 vs 1,000 Hectare Dilemma** - Zero-sum water allocation conflict
6. **Knowledge Without Action** - Monitoring without enforcement authority
7. **Community as Implementers** - Excluded from decision-making
8. **Land Data Black Hole** - Land agency excluded from coordination
9. **Regulatory Contradictions** - Same space = lake + certified land + protected farmland
10. **Budget Allocation Injustice** - 156B Rp to military, 0 Rp to displaced farmers

### Four-Tier Power Structure

**National Level (Power 6-9):**
- Ministry of Environment & Forestry
- Ministry of Public Works
- National Land Agency (*Excluded from coordination*)
- Military (*156 billion Rp contract*)

**Provincial Level (Power 5-6):**
- Lake Management Coordination Body (5-working group structure)
- Provincial Secretariat
- Provincial Agriculture Department
- Provincial Environment Department
- Watershed Management Agency (*Authority reduced post-2017*)

**Local Level (Power 4-5):**
- District Head (*Admitted "wrong study" under pressure*)
- District Secretariat
- Local environmental agencies

**Community Level (Power 2-3):**
- Farmers Forum (1,000+ members)
- Community Elders (historical knowledge)
- Upstream Farmers (1,000 ha)
- Downstream Irrigation (18,000 ha)

## Analytical Themes (A-J)

- **Theme A:** Sedimentation & Lake Degradation (48 million m¬≥ crisis)
- **Theme B:** Multi-Stakeholder Coordination (170 institutions, fragmentation)
- **Theme C:** Water Hyacinth Management (21 ha ‚Üí 280 ha explosion)
- **Theme D:** Agriculture, Farming, Livelihoods (2.5-year ban, zero compensation)
- **Theme E:** Policy, Regulation, Legal Framework (decree resistance)
- **Theme F:** Inter-Agency Gaps & Fragmentation (institutional orphaning, exclusion)
- **Theme G:** Community Perspectives & Land Rights (certification contradictions)
- **Theme H:** Budget, Financing, Resource Allocation (156B injustice)
- **Theme I:** Monitoring, Data Systems, Information (29 stations, no enforcement)
- **Theme J:** Recommendations & Future Directions

## Environmental Justice Analysis

### Three Dimensions of Injustice

**Procedural Justice Violations:**
- Community excluded from coordination body decision-making
- National decree issued without consultation
- Decades of community knowledge ignored

**Distributive Justice Violations:**
- 156 billion Rp to military contractors
- 0 Rp compensation to displaced farmers
- 2.5-year farming ban with continued taxation

**Recognition Justice Violations:**
- "Policy makers are not us, we are just implementers"
- Traditional ecological knowledge delegitimized
- Community knowledge framed as "not expert enough"

## Data Visualization Features

### Interactive Diagram Components

**Node Types:**
- **National Actors** (red circles) - Ministries and national agencies
- **Provincial Actors** (blue circles) - Provincial government bodies
- **Local Actors** (green circles) - District-level government
- **Community Actors** (orange circles) - Farmers, community groups
- **Policies** (gray squares) - Regulations and decrees

**Relationship Types:**
- **Coordination** (black lines) - Official cooperation
- **Conflict** (red lines) - Direct contradictions
- **Budget Flow** (green lines) - Financial allocations
- **Information Flow** (blue lines) - Data sharing
- **Gaps/Exclusions** (gray lines) - Systematic exclusions

**Power Stratification:**
- Node size represents influence level
- Vertical position represents authority hierarchy
- Higher placement = higher formal power

---

## Methodology

**Research Approach:**
- Multi-stakeholder interview analysis
- Regulatory document review
- Policy contradiction mapping
- Power dynamics analysis

**Data Collection:**
- Focus group discussions with government officials
- Individual interviews with community representatives
- Document analysis of 65+ regulations
- Network relationship coding

**Analysis Framework:**
- Environmental justice (procedural, distributive, recognition)
- Power hierarchy mapping (7 tiers)
- Paradox identification (10 institutional failures)
- Theme-based coding (10 analytical themes A-J)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Visualization Technology

**Framework:** D3.js v7 force-directed graph
**Features:**
- Real-time filtering (tier, relationship type, themes)
- Bilingual metadata (Indonesian/English)
- Interactive node details
- Zoom and pan controls
- Search functionality
- Paradox highlighting

**Data Structure:**
- 18 institutional actors
- 11 policies/regulations
- 45 documented relationships
- 10 governance paradoxes
- 170+ coded evidence quotes

---

## Central Finding

**Lake environmental crises stem from governance failure, not technical deficit.**

10 documented paradoxes reveal institutional pathologies: coordination fragmentation, regulatory contradictions, strategic ambiguity, and systematic environmental justice violations.

**Key Insight:** Technical knowledge exists. Monitoring systems function. The failure is institutional: power without accountability, coordination without authority, knowledge without action.

## How to Navigate

1. **Start with the [Interactive Visualization](rawapening-network/index.html)** to explore relationships
2. **Use tier filters** to focus on specific governance levels (National/Provincial/Local/Community)
3. **Click on paradoxes** to understand governance failures
4. **Toggle relationship types** to see coordination vs conflict patterns
5. **Search for actors** to find specific institutional roles

**Tip:** The visualization works best on desktop browsers. Use zoom/pan for detailed exploration.
